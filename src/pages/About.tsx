            Crafted with Love was born from a simple belief: that handmade items carry a special 
            kind of magic that mass-produced goods simply cannot match.

              Founded in 2020, our mission has always been to connect hearts through handmade art. 
              We started as a small studio with just a handful of local artisans, and have grown 
              into a thriving community of talented makers.

            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              Each piece in our shop is created by skilled artisans who pour their heart and soul 
              into their work. From delicate paper crafts to stunning ceramics, every item has been 
              lovingly made by hand.

            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              Our weekend workshops bring people together to learn, create, and share in the joy of 
              making something beautiful with their own hands. We believe that everyone has an inner 
              artist waiting to be discovered.
